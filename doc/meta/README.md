[Poodle](file.VERSION.html)
========

The project includes:

- A ruby based "web" crawler and associated tools
- A ruby on rails based front end to Apache Solr

The aim is to provide simple code which can be easily modified to your own needs. It's useable "out of the box" although I imagine some tinkering and minor cosmetic changes will be need to fit your organization or needs.

I produced this for my own needs and wished something like this had existed at the time.

Help
----

This is a fairly early version, its functional enough to be useful and is being used in earnest ("in production") serving small organisations.

The code is public (on GitHub) so feel free to fix omissions etc. the current wish list of features/fixes are held in [./doc/meta/TODO.md](file.TODO.html). I expect to implement most of this wish list for version `1.0`

What now
--------

1. [Set up your environment](file.INSTALLATION.html)
2. [Index content](./scripts/index.html)
3. [Search content](./poodle/index.html)

If pre-compiled documentation is missing then open up `./doc/meta/INSTALLATION.md` in your favourite text editor. If you have ruby, yard and BlueCloth installed then type: `rake` to generate `./doc/rdoc` (note that the [installation instructions](file.INSTALLATION.html) cover getting the environment configured)

Upgrading

If you are upgrading, please see the [change list](file.CHANGES.html)
